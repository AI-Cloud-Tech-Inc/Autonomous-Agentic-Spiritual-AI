# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Guide for Autonomous-Agentic-Spiritual-AI

## Project Overview

**Autonomous-Agentic-Spiritual-AI** is an autonomous, agentic AI spiritual agent designed to support inner growth, reflection, and well-being. It adapts to user context, emotions, and values, offering ethical, non-dogmatic guidance for mindfulness, self-awareness, and conscious living while preserving human autonomy.

> **Note:** This repository is in its initial phase. No source code, build configuration, test infrastructure, or CI/CD pipelines have been added yet. This file should be updated as the project grows.

## Development Status

The project is at the **initialization stage**. The following have **not yet been established**:

- Programming language / framework selection
- Source code directory structure
- Dependency management (no package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Build system or scripts
- Test framework or test suite
- Linting / formatting configuration
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker or container configuration
- Environment variable configuration

## Conventions for AI Assistants

### General Principles

1. **Respect the project's ethical mission.** This is a spiritual well-being tool. All code, content, and interactions must be non-dogmatic, inclusive, and respectful of diverse spiritual traditions and secular perspectives.
2. **Preserve human autonomy.** The system should guide and suggest, never coerce or manipulate. AI assistants contributing to this codebase should reflect these values in implementation choices.
3. **Keep it simple.** Prefer clear, maintainable code over clever abstractions. This project serves a broad audience — readability matters.
4. **No hardcoded spiritual bias.** Avoid embedding assumptions about any specific religion, philosophy, or spiritual tradition into core logic.

### Code Contributions

- Read existing code before modifying it
- Make minimal, focused changes — avoid scope creep
- Do not add unnecessary dependencies
- Write clear commit messages that explain the "why"
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, or credentials

### When Adding New Features

As the project develops, contributors should:

1. Create source files in appropriate directories (to be established)
2. Add corresponding tests for new functionality
3. Update this CLAUDE.md when project structure or workflows change
4. Follow whatever linting/formatting standards are adopted

## Key Domain Concepts

When working on this codebase, understand these domain-relevant concepts:

- **Agentic AI:** The system operates autonomously, making decisions and taking actions on behalf of users within ethical boundaries
- **Spiritual guidance:** The AI provides reflective prompts, mindfulness exercises, and well-being support — not medical or psychological advice
- **Context adaptation:** The system should adapt to user emotions, values, and personal context
- **Non-dogmatic approach:** Guidance should be universal and not tied to any specific religious framework
- **Conscious living:** Supporting users in living more intentionally and mindfully

## Getting Started (for AI Assistants)

Since the project is in early stages, when asked to implement features:

1. **Propose a structure first** — suggest directory layout, language choice, and framework before writing code
2. **Start with foundational pieces** — configuration, project scaffolding, core abstractions
3. **Add tests alongside code** — establish testing patterns from the beginning
4. **Document as you go** — update this file and add inline documentation for non-obvious logic

## Future Sections (update as project grows)

As the project matures, this file should be expanded with:

- Build and run commands (`npm start`, `python main.py`, etc.)
- Test commands and coverage requirements
- Linting and formatting commands
- Environment setup instructions
- Architecture diagrams or descriptions
- API documentation references
- Deployment procedures
- Branch and PR conventions
