**Morning Gratitude Practice**

Begin your day with intention. Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes, and take three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine gratitude filling your lungs like warm light. As you exhale, release any tension you may be holding.

Bring to mind three things you're grateful for today — they can be simple: the breath in your lungs, the warmth of your cup of tea, the sound of birds outside your window.

**Body Scan for Relaxation**

Lie down or sit comfortably. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Starting at the top of your head, notice any sensations — warmth, coolness, tingling, or tightness. Don't try to change anything; simply observe.

Slowly move your attention down through your body: your forehead, eyes, jaw, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, abdomen, hips, legs, and feet. Spend a few moments with each area, breathing into any tension you find.

**Breathing Into the Heart**

Place your hand over your heart. Feel its steady rhythm — the same rhythm that has carried you through every moment of your life. Breathe deeply, and imagine each inhale bringing peace to your heart space, each exhale releasing worry and stress.

With each breath, repeat silently: "I am at peace. I am safe. I am whole."

**Loving-Kindness Meditation**

Extend your arms outward, palms facing forward. Feel the energy of loving-kindness flowing from your heart. First, direct this warmth toward yourself: "May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be at peace."

Now, bring to mind someone you love. Send these wishes to them. Then, expand outward — to your community, to all beings everywhere. "May all beings be happy. May all beings be healthy. May all beings be at peace."

**Mindful Walking**

If you can, walk slowly around your space. Feel the ground beneath your feet — the texture, the temperature, the support it provides. With each step, be fully present. Notice how your body moves, how your balance shifts.

If thoughts arise, simply acknowledge them and return your attention to the sensation of walking. Each step is a meditation. Each moment is an opportunity to be fully alive.

**Present Moment Awareness**

Close your eyes and ask yourself: "What can I hear right now? What can I feel? What can I smell?" Engage all your senses fully with the present moment.

Notice that in this moment, you are alive. You are breathing. You are here. There is nothing else required of you in this exact moment except to simply be.

**Visualization: Inner Sanctuary**

Close your eyes and imagine a place where you feel completely safe and at peace. It might be a beach, a forest, a mountain meadow, or a cozy room. See the colors, hear the sounds, feel the textures.

This is your inner sanctuary — a place you can return to anytime by simply closing your eyes and breathing deeply. You are always welcome here.

**Letting Go Practice**

Take a deep breath and imagine you're holding a handful of sand. As you slowly open your hand, watch the sand slip away, grain by grain. This is what letting go feels like — gentle, natural, without force.

Identify one thing you're holding onto that no longer serves you. With your next exhale, imagine releasing it, just as the sand falls away. Trust that what needs to leave will leave, making room for what wants to enter.
